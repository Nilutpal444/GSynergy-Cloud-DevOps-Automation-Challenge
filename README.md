# Task: Build and Deploy a Database/Data-Warehouse Server, Airflow Server, and Set Up CI/CD


Step 1: Database Server (AWS Redshift)

Explanation: In this step, we'll use Terraform to provision an AWS Redshift database server. Redshift is a fully managed data warehouse service in AWS.

main.tf: This Terraform configuration file defines the AWS provider, region, and the AWS Redshift cluster resource.

provider "aws": Specifies the AWS provider and sets the desired region.

resource "aws_redshift_cluster": Defines an AWS Redshift cluster. We can customize the cluster settings such as node type, master username, password, and security groups.


Step 2: Airflow Server (AWS EC2)

Explanation: In this step, we'll use Terraform to provision an AWS EC2 instance that will host Apache Airflow. Airflow is an open-source platform for workflow automation.

main.tf: This Terraform configuration file defines the AWS provider and the AWS EC2 instance resource.

resource "aws_instance": Specifies an AWS EC2 instance. We can customize the AMI (Amazon Machine Image), instance type, key pair for SSH access, and security groups.


Step 3: Data Pipeline (AWS Glue - Optional)

Explanation: If we choose to use AWS Glue for data processing and transformation, you would define Glue resources using Terraform. AWS Glue is a fully managed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) service.

Creating Glue resources is complex and we would need to define Glue jobs, connections, crawlers, and databases in Terraform.


Step 4: CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins)

Explanation: In this step, we'll set up a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment of infrastructure and data.

Jenkinsfile: This is a Jenkins pipeline script written in Groovy. It defines the pipeline stages and steps:

Build and Deploy IaC: Terraform commands are executed to initialize and apply the infrastructure-as-code (IaC) configurations in the "iac" directory. This stage deploys the Redshift cluster and Airflow EC2 instance.

Data Loading: A Python script (load_data.py) is executed to upload data files from the "data" folder to a data storage location (e.g., S3).

Deploy Airflow DAGs: If we have Airflow DAGs to deploy, we can add steps to upload and configure them.

Run Tests: We can add test scripts or commands to validate the deployed infrastructure and data pipelines.

Post Actions: Depending on success or failure, we can define post-build actions, such as notifications or cleanup.


Step 5: Data Loading Scripts (Python)

Explanation: In this step, we use a Python script to upload data files from the "data" folder to a data storage location (e.g., S3).

load_data.py: This Python script utilizes the AWS CLI (aws s3 cp) to copy data files from the "data" folder to an S3 bucket. It assumes that we have the AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials.
